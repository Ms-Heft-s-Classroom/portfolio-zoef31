    <h2>Why I Like My Momma</h2>
    <p2>first of all, she is my mom so I have to like her at least a little since she birthed me but I like her because shes silly and she's one of my bffs.</p2>
    <p2>she lets me do things I want as long as it doesn't hurt no one and its reasonable. She also lets me have my bffs over whenever because we never really have plans and she loves Mackenzie too</p2>
    <p2>Shes been letting me drive since I was like 14 so she obviously trusts me with her life she could've died because 14 year old me was not a smooth driver</p2>
    <p2>We hangout a lot and we loveeeeeee shopping and spending her money. I like to call it our money but she don't like that so we spend her money. We love to buy things off amazon and she really loves Temu now.</p2>
    <p2>We love making fun of people too, not to their faces but like if someones driving really bad we like to make fun of them until we pass them and get to see their face.</p2>

    <h2>Why My Momma Is Better Than Yours</h2>
    <p3>Ummm, your mom might be cool, but she's not cooler than mine. I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings but you need to hear the truth.</p3>
    <p3>My mom is my twin so she's basically me and I'm the best of the best so obviously we are on top. My mom isn't afraid to hurt feelings and will yell at anyone who deserves it...</p3> 
    <p3>My mom is also really good at yelling, I would know. </p3>
