  <p>I have two cats, Duncan and Jasmine. Duncan is almost 8 years old, his birthday is in November. Jasmine is 6, her birthday is in April.<br>
    <p>We got Duncan when he was only a couple weeks old, he was a stray and my moms friend gave him to us. He is my little boy and I love him more than life. I share my food with him and he waits in th bathroom for m when I shower.<br>
<p>We got Jasmine when she was a couple months old, she was also a stray but for much longer than Duncan so she s very skiddish. She is my baby girl, she is gorg and can do no wrong.<br>

<h2>Duncan</h2>
<h3>Duncan is so sweety. He loves love but does bite if he has too much love from me. He loves to eat, sometimes he eats too fast then gets sick and throws up.</h3>
